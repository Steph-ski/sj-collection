# Collection Application 

Displays a collection of items with key details, which updates when new items are added. Built using HTML, CSS and PHP.

## Description

In this individual project, I created an SQL dataset with stats for each item being displayed on the end point page.  I also built functionality to be able to add new items to the database via a insert statement, which also updates automatically to display on the end point page.   User input is validated by bespoke REGEX as well as utilising PHP built in santisiation and validation.
